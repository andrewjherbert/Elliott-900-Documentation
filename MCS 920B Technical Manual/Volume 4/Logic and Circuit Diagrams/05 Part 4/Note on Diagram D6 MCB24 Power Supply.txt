FROGGATT 08/04/2019CIRCUIT DIAGRAM D6: The three boards underneath an MCB24 are, in order:   Front   4006  MR2 volts =0 & >12  therefore +6v,   Middle  4006  MR2 volts <0 & >6   therefore -6v,   Rear    4009                      therefore +15v.The layout of 2N3055 transistors is:   Relays  Capacitors  Transformer   Front    +15v +15v +15v   Middle    +5v  -5v  -5v   Rear      +5v  +5v  +5vWiring colour code: Emitter resistors Blue wires (6),   Bases Yellow wires (4), and Collectors Mounting bolts (3).The three heatsinks appear to be identical, but with the middle   one the opposite way up, so that its transistors line up with   the holes in the other two, thus reversing their E & B pins.The middle row +5v transistor is isolated from its heat sink. Errors in circuit diagram D6.   D6 shows differing numbers of transistors on each of      the 3 boards, and a total of seven off-board 2N2055s.   In fact there are 6 transistors on each board, including      one 2N3055 on each, and a total of nine off-board 2N3055s.   Specifically, VT3 & VT13, shown on-board, are off-board.   Each board has three STO5 transistors,      VT24 & VT26 on board 4009 are shown as PNP,      the other seven as NPN, all nine should be NPN.      (See "Radio Valve Data" 8th edition page 109, Iliffe 1966)Although there are two 4006 boards, circuit diagram D6   correctly shows that they differ regarding R4-v-R22.Values in circuit diagram D6.   D6 shows R1 R19 R34 as 1Kohm.      R1 is actually 820ohm on Santype & Warwick MCB24s.   D6 shows R5-8 R23-24 as 1ohm & R41-43 as 2.2ohm.      All nine are actually 1ohm on Santype MCB24.   D6 shows R4 as 330ohm & R22 as 470ohm.      R4 is actually 270ohm on Santype & MobilX8K MCB24s.   I have NOT checked these values on all four of my MCB24s.
