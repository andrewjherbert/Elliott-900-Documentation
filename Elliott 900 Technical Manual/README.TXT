This folder contains scanned copies of the Elliott 900/903 Technical
Manual.

This was the principal documentation issued with software to 903
customers.

The manuals comprised 10 grey binders.

This folder contains reconstructions of those binders from the copies
held by Andrew Herbert, Terry Froggatt and at the National Museum of
Computing.  All have been compared and the scanned versions made up
from the merged contents, using the latest issue pages.  Andrew's set,
which were issued to machine 1558 sold to the British Ceramic Research
Association form the largest portion.

Neither Terry nor I have yet found the Engineering & Maintenance
section relating to Power Supplies and Extended Store.  However this
information can be found in the Elliott 920B Technical Manual, which
predated the 903 Manual.  (It is also very clearly the text on which
the 900 Technical Manual was based, but organised differently).

The file Errata.docx contains a list of errors noted in the
documentation discovered when writing demonstration programs etc. It
is a work in progress.
