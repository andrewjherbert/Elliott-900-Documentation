      =============================
      Volume 4 : Engineering Maintenance
      Part   4 : Peripheral Equipment
      Copy No. 4E/ 266  (From Warwick)


I found three Magtape figures in Part 3, which were missing from
   Part 4, so I've moved them into Part 4 and included them below.
I've also moved figures A and B, from after the Appendices
   to in front of them, to agree with the Contents pages.
