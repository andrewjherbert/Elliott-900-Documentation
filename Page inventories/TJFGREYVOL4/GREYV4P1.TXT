      =============================
      Volume 4 : Engineering Maintenance
      Part   1 : Basic Equipment
      Copy No. 4A/ 68  (From ECUA)


I'd never really needed to audit this ringbinder before,
   because I have similar information in other files.
It appeared to contain section 4, teleprinter,
   at issue 2, plus the update sheets for issue 3, so I've
   implemented the update & not listed the obsolete pages.
Section 2, punch & reader, & section 5, on-line adaptor,
   only contained the update sheets for issue 3,
   (which include some issue 2 pages on their other sides),
   but I do not have the issue 2 sections to apply them to.
