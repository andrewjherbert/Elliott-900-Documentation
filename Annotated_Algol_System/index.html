<h1>Elliott 903 Algol Resurrection</h1>

<p>
The two main high-level programming languages on the Elliott 903 were Algol 60 and
FORTRAN&nbsp;II. The source code of the Algol system has survived. Unfortunately the
source of the FORTRAN system has not.
</p>
<p>
As well as the source code of the Algol system, documentation written by the
designers of the system has also survived.  This comprises type-written notes
describing the working of the system in some detail and hand-written flow charts
for the main routines in the system.
</p>

<h2>Elliott 903 Algol 60</h2>

<p>
The Elliott 903 Algol 60 system implements the "IFIP Subset" of Algol 60.  The subset
introduces various restrictions including requiring identifiers to be declared before
first reference, recursive procedures disallowed, no <u>own</u> variables. Despite these
restrictions, Elliott 903 Algol remains a useful language for numerical computing.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="../Elliott 900 Technical Manual/Volume 2A Programming Information/05 Volume 2 Part 1 Section 2 - ALGOL.pdf">
programmer's manual for Elliott 903 Algol</a> describes the facilities and restrictions
of Elliott 903 Algol and instructions for operating the paper tape based Algol 60 system.
It should be read first to understand the overall structure and operation of the
Elliott Algol 60 system.
</p>

<p>
The Elliott 903 Algol system comprises three components:

<ol>
<li>A <b>Translator</b> which reads in Algol program source code, checks it for errors and
outputs a "intermediate tape" encoding the program as data and instructions for an
abstract Algol machine.
</li>
<li>
A runtime <b>Interpreter</b> which reads in the intermediate tape, loads it into the
store and then executes it, simulating the operation of the abstract machine.
</li>
<li>
A <b>Library</b> of procedures for mathematical functions, input-output formatting, etc.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
In concept Elliott Algol follows the same approach as taken by Whetstone Algol for the
English Electric KDF9 computer, although the translator is quite different, being of the
recursive descent type rather than table-driven.  The Elliott and Whetstone interpreters
are however very similar.
</p>

<p>
Central to the Elliott 903 Algol system is the Object Code generated by the Translator
and executed by the Interpreter. The
<a href="../Elliott 903 ALGOL Design Documents/Elliott 903 ALGOL Object Code.pdf">
Algol Object Code Manual</a> should be read before
diving into the code and documentation of the Translator and Interpreter.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: The source code for the Elliott Algol system is the last major version (Issue 6)
released by Elliotts. (There was a subsequent release of a revised, Issue 7, Library
tape). The handwritten documentation and the flow charts date back to the initial releases
of the system and there are some discrepancies between these and the code - mostly fixing
errors encountered in the code after the initial release.  At Issue 6 there was a
significant change in the Interpreter, when the global workspace was moved higher in the
store - this is explained in the section of the programming manual dealing with writing
code procedures. Since the code references the workspace using labels this is mostly
transparent to the documentation, but be wary of statements made about the contents of
specific absolute addresses. In all cases the source code is authoritative and has been
validated against the issued binary paper tapes.

Programming information, including a description of the supported Algol features, the
Library and operating instructions for the Elliott 903 Algol System is given in

<h2>Translator</h2>

<p>
Here is an
<a href="../Elliott%20903%20ALGOL%20Design%20Documents/Annotated_Algol_System/Translator/Translator_Description.htm">
HTML listing of the Algol Translator document</a>.  It is a hyperlinked document so
that you can navigate around the content and importantly so you can cross-refer back from
the mention of an identifier in the source code to a description of it's meaning.  For
each major subroutine described in the document there are links to the source code, also
in HTML, and to the individual flowchart for that subroutine. There are also links back to
the original scanned page from each page in the HTML so you can check that the HTML
listing is consistent with the original.

<h2>Summary of Emulation Facilities</h2>

<p>
There is an
<a href="http://ajhrpi002.ddns.net/ELLALG/117400/elliott/elliott.htm">
online facility</a>
that allows you to type in an Algol program, then translate and run it.
</p>

<p>
There are also facilities for running an emulated Elliott 903 on your own computer and
an
<a href="https://andrewjherbert.github.io/Elliott-900-software-archive/">
extensive archive of Elliott software</a>,
including all the major language systems and utility software provided by Elliotts to
customers.
<p>

<p>
The
<a href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/Elliott-900-simulator">
most comprehensive emulator</a>
is written for Windows 7 and Windows 10.  It includes a large suite
of canned demonstrations of all the software in the software archive.  It comes with
a detailed manual.  The less experienced user will probably be content to install the
emulator and run the demonstrations.  For the more experienced user it is possible to
write you own scripts to add further demonstrations, debug them and deal with
conversions between the various data formats used by the emultor.
</p>

<p>
A
<a href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/900-Simulator-in-C">
simpler and more portable emulator</a>
has been written in C and intended to run in Unix command line environments such
as Linux and MacOS (terminal command).  It comes with a small number of
demonstrations and by using these as an example, the more experienced user will
be able to write their own shell scripts to run programs.
